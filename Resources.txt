These are some resources I used while at home to finish my program:

https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Generators_and_Comprehensions.html#generator-expressions 
- stuff like '(row[1] for row in csv.reader(f) if row and row[0] == UsernameInput)' 
If what I know is correct, returns the first row[1] (password) that is true (row) and the username attached to it is the user's input (the ', none' is the default)
this was really cool to learn, forgot the OG tutorial I watched. I still want to learn a lot more about this though

https://realpython.com/python-enumerate/
- Teaches enumerate. Basically first var is count/index, second var is holding the info like normal. It's like having for _ in _ and a for _ in range(0,_)

There are some others, specifically for file stuff but I lost the links, my bad
